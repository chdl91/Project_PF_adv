# 🍕 PizzaRP – Pizzeria Reference Project (Browser App)

> 🚧 Replace the screenshot with one that shows your main screen.

![UI Showcase](docs/ui-images/ui_showcase.png)

---

This project is intended to:

- Practice the complete process from **application requirements analysis to implementation**
- Apply advanced **Python** concepts in a browser-based application (NiceGUI)
- Demonstrate **data validation**, a clean architecture (presentation / application logic / persistence), and **database access via ORM**
- Produce clean, well-structured, and documented code (incl. tests)
- Prepare students for **teamwork and professional documentation**
- Use this repository as a starting point by importing it into your own GitHub account  
- Work only within your own copy — do not push to the original template  
- Commit regularly to track your progress

# 🍕 TEMPLATE for documentation

> 🚧 Please remove the paragraphs marked with "🚧". These are comments for preparing the documentation.

---

## 📝 Application Requirements

---

### Problem

> 🚧 Describe the real-world problem your application solves. (Not HOW, but WHAT)

💡 Example: In a small local pizzeria, the staff writes orders and calculates totals by hand. This causes mistakes and inconsistent orders or discounts.

---

### Scenario

> 🚧 Describe when and how a user will use your application

💡 Example: PizzaRP solves the part of the problem where orders and totals are created by letting a user select items from a menu, validating the inputs, storing orders in a database, and automatically generating a correct invoice.

---

### User stories

### User stories

1. **As a user, I want to see the pizza menu in the Browser App.**  
   **Description:** The application displays all available pizzas with relevant information.  
   **Inputs:** optional filter as `str`  
   **Outputs:** pizza list as `list[Pizza]`

2. **As a user, I want to select pizzas and see the running total.**  
   **Description:** The user adds pizzas with quantities to the current order, and the total updates automatically.  
   **Inputs:** pizza ID as `int`, quantity as `int`  
   **Outputs:** current order as `Order`, subtotal as `float`

3. **As a user, I want a discount of 10% to be applied automatically, if the sum exceeds 50 Swiss Franks.**  
   **Description:** The application checks the subtotal and applies the discount automatically when the threshold is reached.  
   **Inputs:** subtotal as `float`  
   **Outputs:** discount as `float`, total as `float`

4. **As a user, I want an invoice to be created and saved as a file.**  
   **Description:** After checkout, the application generates and stores an invoice file.  
   **Inputs:** completed order as `Order`, customer name as `str`  
   **Outputs:** invoice file path as `str`

5. **As an admin, I want to see all past transactions, ordered by date.**  
   **Description:** The admin can view saved orders sorted by date.  
   **Inputs:** optional sort direction as `str`  
   **Outputs:** transaction list as `list[Transaction]`

---

### Use cases

> 🚧 Name actors and briefly describe each use case. Ideally, a UML use case diagram specifies use cases and relationships.

![UML Use Case Diagram](docs/architecture-diagrams/uml_use_case_diagram.png)

**Use cases**
- Show Menu (Customer)
- Create Order / Add Items (Customer)
- Show Current Order and Total (Customer)
- Checkout & Print Invoice (Staff) → generates `invoice_xxx.pdf`
- View Past Transactions (Admin)

**Actors**
- Customer (places orders)
- Staff (processes/prints invoices)
- Admin (reviews transactions)

---

### Wireframes / Mockups

> 🚧 Add screenshots of the wireframe mockups you chose to implement.

![Wireframe – Home](docs/ui-images/wireframe_home.png)
![Wireframe – Checkout](docs/ui-images/wireframe_checkout.png)

---

## 🏛️ Architecture

> 🚧 Document the architecture components, relationships, and key design decisions.

### Software Architecture

> 🚧 Insert your UML class diagram(s). Split into multiple diagrams if needed.

![UML Class Diagram](docs/architecture-diagrams/uml_class_architecture.png)

**Layers / components:**
- UI (NiceGUI pages/components, browser as thin client)
- Application logic (controllers + domain/services)
- Persistence (SQLite + ORM entities + repositories/queries)

**Design decisions (examples):**
- Organize code using **MVC**:
   - **Model:** domain + ORM entities (e.g. `models.py`)
   - **View:** NiceGUI UI components/pages
   - **Controller:** event handlers and coordination logic between UI, services, and persistence
- Separate UI (`app/main.py`) from domain logic (e.g. `pricing.py`) and persistence (e.g. `models.py`, `db.py`)
- Use and interaction of modules to minimize dependencies, by minimizing cohesion and maximizing coupling
- Keep business rules testable without starting the UI

**Design patterns used (examples):**
- MVC (Model–View–Controller)
- Repository/DAO for database access (e.g. `queries.py`)
- Strategy for business rules (e.g. discount calculation)
- Adapter for external services (e.g. invoice generation backend)

---

### 🗄️ Database and ORM

> 🚧 Describe the database and your ORM entities. Ideally, a diagram documents the database and it is described together with the ORM entities.

![ER Diagram](docs/architecture-diagrams/er_diagram.png)

**ORM and Entities (example):** In the database, order are stored in ... that are mapped an `Order` entity. The `Order` ↔ `OrderItem` relationship ... ensures that an `Order` has at least one `OrderItem` and an `OrderItem` always relates to an `Order`.

---

## ✅ Project Requirements

---

> 🚧 Requirements act as a contract: implement and demonstrate each point below.

Each app must meet the following criteria in order to be accepted (see also the official project guidelines PDF on Moodle):

1. Using NiceGUI for building an interactive web app
2. Data validation in the app
3. Using an ORM for database management

---

### 1. Browser-based App (NiceGUI)

> 🚧 In this section, document how your project fulfills each criterion.

The application interacts with the user via the browser. Users can:

- View the pizza menu
- Select pizzas and quantities
- See the running total
- Receive an invoice generated as a file

**Architecture note (per SS26 guidelines):** the browser is a thin client; UI state + business logic live on the server-side NiceGUI app.

---

### 2. Data Validation

The application validates all user input to ensure data integrity and a smooth user experience.
These checks prevent crashes and guide the user to provide correct input, matching the validation requirements described in the project guidelines.

---

### 3. Database Management

All relevant data is managed via an ORM (e.g. SQLModel or SQLAlchemy). For the pizza example this includes users, pizzas, and orders.

---

## ⚙️ Implementation

---

### Technology

- Python 3.x
- Environment: GitHub Codespaces
- External libraries (e.g. NiceGUI, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic)

---
