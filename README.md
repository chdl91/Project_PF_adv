- Demonstrate **data validation**, a clean architecture (presentation / application logic / persistence), and **database access via ORM**
- Produce clean, well-structured, and documented code (incl. tests)
- Prepare students for **teamwork and professional documentation**
- Use this repository as a starting point by importing it into your own GitHub account  
- Work only within your own copy — do not push to the original template  
- Commit regularly to track your progress

## 📝 Application Requirements

---

### Problem *Added from Phase 1*

> We learn a lot of material in this semester that is crucial to our further education. This can be overwhelming or even frightening. The material is spread over various Moodles / Inside FHNW, which is chaotic.

---

### Scenario *Added  from Phase 1*

> To enhance the learning process we aim to crate a catalouge of questions which will be presented as a quiz to prepare for our assesment exams. The quiz will be asking questions from one subject and split into chapters. The type of questions will be mulitple choice. The Answers will be validated and give an indication of right or wrong and will also show an explanation. At the end of the quiz, the user will be given a score.

---

### Software Architecture

> 🚧 Insert your UML class diagram(s). Split into multiple diagrams if needed.

![UML Class Diagram](docs/architecture-diagrams/uml_class_architecture.png)

**Layers / components:**
- UI (NiceGUI pages/components, browser as thin client)
- Application logic (controllers + domain/services)
- Persistence (SQLite + ORM entities + repositories/queries)

**Design decisions (examples):**
- Organize code using **MVC**:
   - **Model:** domain + ORM entities (e.g. `models.py`)
   - **View:** NiceGUI UI components/pages
   - **Controller:** event handlers and coordination logic between UI, services, and persistence
- Separate UI (`app/main.py`) from domain logic (e.g. `pricing.py`) and persistence (e.g. `models.py`, `db.py`)
- Use and interaction of modules to minimize dependencies, by minimizing cohesion and maximizing coupling
- Keep business rules testable without starting the UI

**Design patterns used (examples):**
- MVC (Model–View–Controller)
- Repository/DAO for database access (e.g. `queries.py`)
- Strategy for business rules (e.g. discount calculation)
- Adapter for external services (e.g. invoice generation backend)

---

### 🗄️ Database and ORM

> 🚧 Describe the database and your ORM entities. Ideally, a diagram documents the database and it is described together with the ORM entities.

![ER Diagram](docs/architecture-diagrams/er_diagram.png)

**ORM and Entities (example):** In the database, order are stored in ... that are mapped an `Order` entity. The `Order` ↔ `OrderItem` relationship ... ensures that an `Order` has at least one `OrderItem` and an `OrderItem` always relates to an `Order`.

---

## ✅ Project Requirements

---

> 🚧 Requirements act as a contract: implement and demonstrate each point below.

Each app must meet the following criteria in order to be accepted (see also the official project guidelines PDF on Moodle):

1. Using NiceGUI for building an interactive web app
2. Data validation in the app
3. Using an ORM for database management

---

### 1. Browser-based App (NiceGUI)

> 🚧 In this section, document how your project fulfills each criterion.

The application interacts with the user via the browser. Users can:

- View the pizza menu
- Select pizzas and quantities
- See the running total
- Receive an invoice generated as a file

**Architecture note (per SS26 guidelines):** the browser is a thin client; UI state + business logic live on the server-side NiceGUI app.

---

### 2. Data Validation

The application validates all user input to ensure data integrity and a smooth user experience.
These checks prevent crashes and guide the user to provide correct input, matching the validation requirements described in the project guidelines.

---

### 3. Database Management

All relevant data is managed via an ORM (e.g. SQLModel or SQLAlchemy). For the pizza example this includes users, pizzas, and orders.

---

## ⚙️ Implementation

---

### Technology

- Python 3.x
- Environment: GitHub Codespaces
- External libraries: nicegui, sqlmodel, sqlalchemy, reportlab, python-dotenv, pytest, tzdata

### How to Run

> 🚧 Adjust to your project.

### 1. Project Setup
- Python 3.13 (or the course version) is required
- Create and activate a virtual environment:
   - **macOS/Linux:**
      ```bash
      python3 -m venv .venv
      source .venv/bin/activate
      ```
   - **Windows:**
      ```bash
      python -m venv .venv
      .venv\Scripts\Activate
      ```
- Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### 2. Configuration
- E.g., setup of parameters or environment variables

### 3. Launch
- Start the NiceGUI app (example):
   ```bash
   py -m pizza_app
   ```
- Open the URL printed in the console.

### 4. Usage (document as steps)

> 🚧 Describe the usage of the main functions

Order Pizza:
1. Open the menu page and browse pizzas.
2. Add items (with quantities) to the current order.
3. Review total (incl. discounts) and validate inputs.
4. Checkout to persist the order and generate the invoice.

> 🚧 Add UI screenshots of the main screens (or a short video link):

![UI – Checkout](docs/ui-images/ui_checkout_screen.png)
![UI – Past Transactions](docs/ui-images/ui_past_transactions_screen.png)

---

## 🧪 Testing

> 🚧 Explain what you test and how to run tests.

**Test mix:**
- Overall 12 tests
- 6 Unit tests: e.g. subtotal calculation, discount application above CHF 50, no discount at or below threshold, total calculation
- 3 DB tests: e.g. menu query returns seeded pizzas, saving an order persists order + order items, empty DB / empty transactions behavior
- 3 Integration tests: e.g. checkout with one pizza creates order and invoice, checkout with multiple pizzas applies discount correctly

**Template for writing test cases**
1. Test case ID – unique identifier (e.g., TC_001)
2. Test case title/description – What is the test about?
3. Preconditions: Requirements before executing the test
4. Test steps: Actions to perform
5. Test data/input
6. Expected result
7. Actual result
8. Status – pass or fail
9. Comments – Additional notes or defect found

**Run:**
```bash
pytest
```

> 🚧 If you provide separate commands, document them here (e.g. `pytest -m integration`).
